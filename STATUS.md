# Status updates for the Open Food Facts project

## How it works

All participants to the Open Food Facts project are encouraged to share updates on what they are working on using this status page.

You can edit the weekly status at any time during the week, using the "Working on this week" section to put a 1 line summary (add link to bugs etc. to provide more details).
When a task is done, move it to the "Completed this week" section.

Projects that have planned resources (e.g. GSOC projects) should also complete the "To be worked on this week" and "To be worked on next week" sections.

At the end of the week, the weekly status update will be posted to the #general channel on Slack, and a new weekly update will be created at the top of the page.
